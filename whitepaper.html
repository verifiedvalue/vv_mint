        <h1>Button Game v1.0</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>ButtonGamev1</strong> is an onchain game designed to give away <strong>200k $DEGEN</strong> where the last player to press the button wins. There is a small fee to press the button. This fee is added to the giveaway pot.
        </p>

        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>ButtonGamev1</strong> uses multiple onchain variables to determine the game state and endgame handling. 
            All game variables are handled by the contract.  
            All gameplay is dependent on confirmed transactions.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Contract Variables</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>pot</strong>: Stores the current value of the pot.<br>
            <strong>blockTarget</strong>: Stores the target block number to determine the end of the game.<br>
            <strong>currentWinner</strong>: Stores the address of the current game winner.<br>
            <strong>endGameMet</strong>: Indicates whether the end game condition is met.<br>
        </p>

        <!-- More details about contract functions, events, etc. can be added here -->

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
            <p>There are a few key values when it comes to ButtonGame.</p>
            <p><strong>1. The Pot: </strong>The current contract account balance. This will be transferred to the winner if the block target is reached.</p> 
            <p><strong>2. The Block Target: </strong>The block target is set and updated each time the button is pressed (current block + 100). If the button is pressed while (current block >= block target) the game has ended and the tx will be rejected.</p>
            <p><strong>3. The Current Winner: </strong>This is the last player to press the button. If the block target is reached before another confirmed button press is recorded, this player will win the pot.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Free Play: </strong>1 Free Play will be available to each of the first 69 unique wallets.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Play: </strong>Pressing the button will cost 69 $degen. 90% is added to the pot. 10% is directed to the team.</p>
